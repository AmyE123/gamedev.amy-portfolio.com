summary: "One day, in this little town of Dice people, a bakery opens. You start your trial shift, turning a blind eye to the cannibalism around you. Luckily for you, the customers are kind enough to bring their own recipes! This was designed around the theme 'Roll of the Dice' <small>(GMTK Gamejam 2022)</small>"

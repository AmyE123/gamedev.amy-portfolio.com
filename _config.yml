# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: "Hi! I'm Amy, a UK-based awards-winning programmer. I love technical and creative experimentation, often participating in game jams and small projects. I enjoy exploring various genres and pushing my creative and technical boundaries. I'm always eager to learn, whether it's mastering game engines, diving into programming problems, or tackling fun projects with weird hardware. One of my goals is to inspire younger and diverse individuals to explore game development. I've mentored students, spoken at events, high schools, colleges and universities, and appeared as a panellist at events like the Women in Games Expo."

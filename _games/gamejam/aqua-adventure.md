<h3 style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">Taking On The Programming Myself</h3>
<p>Being a solo-programmer on this game meant that <b>I had to handle a lot of work - And I was prepared for this!</b> Some things which I had to work on during this project involve source control, and implementing all my teams' models, and game mechanics inside of Unity (Our game engine). <br /> As I mentioned, I asked the team if I can take on the entirety of the programming myself as a <b>personal challenge</b>, and I'm very happy they let me do that, as it allowed me to challenge myself, and although I got stressed near the end of the game jam, <b>it helped me learn what I can accomplish and what my limits are when working by myself on programming.</b> But I also shouldn't be afraid to ask for help from others if I am starting to feel stressed.</p>

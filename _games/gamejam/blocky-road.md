# Project Overview
heading: "Complete both sides of a rotating puzzle."
summary: "Blocky Road is a puzzle game designed around the theme 'Hyper-Casual'. <small>(TDEMO Hypercasual)</small> <br/> Through making this game, I learned that for gamejams it is okay if the code is unoptimized, as the goal is to make a working game within the limited time."
